### Presentation Layer:

> This layer is responsible for the user interface and user experience. It communicates with the application layer to present the data to the user and receive user inputs.

### Application Layer:

> This layer is responsible for implementing the business logic and coordinating the actions of the other layers. It communicates with the domain layer to perform operations on the domain model and with the infrastructure layer to persist data and perform other technical operations.

### Domain Layer:

> This layer represents the core of the system and contains the domain model and the business logic. It is responsible for representing the business entities, relationships, and operations, and for enforcing the business rules.

### Infrastructure Layer:

> This layer is responsible for providing technical services to the application layer, such as data persistence, messaging, and other low-level operations.

### extends Layer:

> This layer is responsible for providing interfaces to extend business logic which the function is customized, such as barcode parse extends.

**This is a common architecture for a WMS, but the number of layers and the specific design can vary depending on the
requirements and constraints of the system.**
